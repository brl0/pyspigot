Planned Features
================

PySpigot is an evolving project. I have several features planned in future releases. This is a non-comprehensive list of features I plan on adding in the future:

* :strike:`Overhaul access to PySpigot's managers` Done
* Allow scripts to create and register their own events
* Script loading delay on a per-script basis
* Ability to create and send packets via protocol manager (through ProtocolLib)
* Add "stop" function to all scripts that will be called when a script is stopped or unloaded
* Per-script logging (log to file as well as to console for each script)
* Allow scripts to stop themselves as well as start/stop other scripts (via script manager)
